    <h2>The Mountain of God</h2>
    <p>You may have heard the story of the Mountain of God where people say that there are many paths to the top of the mountain.  When people tell me this story they say it does not matter which path you take because they all lead to top. </p>  <p>And what will we find at the top of this mountain? Some people say we will find God, others talk of Moksha, others say enlightenment, some say paradise and others heaven.  </p>
    <p>I am a mountain climber and I know that climbers choose different paths up a mountain based on their skills, preferences, or circumstances.  Some climbers prefer rugged terrain, while others of us prefer gentler slopes.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to climb Mt Hood, in the United States, twice.  The first time the weather was great, and I was successful.  The second time I followed the same route but had to turn back because of bad weather.  </p>
<p>Mt Everest has been even harder for people to climb.  No one was successful until 1953 when  Tenzing and Edmund Hillary reached the summit.  Why were they successful when everyone else had failed?  They had an external oxygen supply.  You see the air is so thin near the top of Mt Everest that no one can survive without an extra oxygen source.</p>

<p>The lack of oxygen held people back from reaching the summit of Mt Everest for thousands of years.
In the same way there is something which holds us back from reaching the summit of the Mountain of God.

Some people call this our Karma.  Others use the words ‘our imperfections’, or ‘our sins’.</p>

<p>God is holy and only those who are perfectly holy can reach the top of the Mountain of God. That means we can all start up the mountain of God on different paths, but we will all hit a barrier which will stop us from making further progress.  No amount of self-effort, prayer, or sacrifice will allow us to move up the mountain past this barrier.</p>

<p>So, the Lord Jesus came down from the top of the mountain. Lord Jesus is perfectly holy so he can live at the top of the Mountain of God.  But because of his great love for us he came down to our level.  He made a great sacrifice for you.  Lord Jesus is offering to take you to the top of the Mountain of God.</p>

<p>Remember, people can not reach the top of Mt Everest unless they rely on an external oxygen supply.  In the same way you can not reach the top of the mountain of God unless you rely on what Lord Jesus has done for you.</p>

<p>Why is Lord Jesus so special? Why is he a guru worth following? Watch the next video for the story of His Birth.</p>
