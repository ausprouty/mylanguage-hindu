<h1 class="title">Lord Shri Jesus and the Remedy for Karma</h1>

<p>
    Just a few centuries before our brilliant and compassionate Siddhartha Gautama sat under the Bodhi tree to meditate on ways of remedying the impact of Karma, God made another startling progressive revelation: a prophecy concerning Lord Shri Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
    "But he was pierced for our transgressions, <br>
    he was crushed for our iniquities; <br>
    the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, <br>
    and by his wounds we are healed."
</blockquote>

<p>
    God, out of deep love for us, was revealing the remedy for Karma in Lord Shri Jesus’ ultimate sacrifice: that he would take on the punishment we all deserve and free us from the bondage of Karma and Samsara permanently!
</p>

<h2 class="subhead">Buddhism, OM, and the Incomprehensible God</h2>

<p>
    Some believe the teachings of Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama) are close to the Nir-Guna-Brahma concept (God is incomprehensible), which goes back a few millenniums before Buddha. According to this teaching, God's attributes are incomprehensible to humans; however, there is one utterance or word that is used to refer to this form of God. It is <strong>OM</strong> (pronounced AUM). OM is believed to be the primal vibration, never created, existing before the universe, and continuing eternally.
</p>

<p>
    OM holds a very significant place in our culture: our Sanskrit chants usually begin with OM to honor the infinite, eternal God. In the <em>Gnana marga</em> (Path of self-knowledge), some practitioners meditate on OM to gain God-Consciousness. OM has become the icon of Hinduism, reflecting humanity's deep hunger to know and experience God personally.
</p>

<h2 class="subhead">Lord Shri Jesus Jayanti: The Universal Gift</h2>

<p>
    How can we know and experience this incomprehensible universal reality, God? That is where <strong>Lord Shri Jesus Jayanti</strong> (Lord Shri Jesus's Birthday) fits in. God, who created the stars and planets, gave the East clues about this birth event through astronomy. The Bethlehem star guided people from the East to witness Lord Shri Jesus’ birth.
</p>

<p>
    Despite the mystery, God invites us to connect with Him by unwrapping His interactive Gift. Can God, who knows our innermost thoughts, ignore our plea? No way! However, we must address a barrier before beginning a relationship with God.
</p>

<h2 class="subhead">The Barrier: Karma and Maya</h2>

<p>
    In our natural state, we are disconnected from God, as also recognized by Eastern teachings. Hinduism identifies two root issues: <strong>Karma</strong> (the binding cycle of cause and effect, Samsara) and <strong>Maya</strong> (the illusion of our true nature). God's recovery mechanism addresses both Karma and Maya effectively.
</p>

<p>
    Lord Shri Jesus Jayanti occurred for our benefit. Lord Shri Jesus, who existed eternally (similar to OM), entered humanity to become comprehensible. He revealed God’s nature through His life and became our <em>prayaschit</em> (compensation) for Karma. To receive this gift, we must break free from Maya and yield to God’s way.
</p>

<h2 class="subhead">The True Christmas Gift</h2>

<p>
    After Lord Shri Jesus's death as our <em>prayaschit</em>, He came alive again in the same body and gave us an interactive Gift: the <strong>Pavitra-Atma</strong> (Holy Spirit), God Himself, who brings spiritual life into our <em>Atma</em> (spirit). Our disconnected Atma reconnects with God when we acknowledge Lord Shri Jesus's sacrifice and receive God as our internal Guru. Through surrender, we allow the Guru to transform us to be like Lord Shri Jesus.
</p>

<p>
    This mystery was hidden from our culture for centuries. But now, if we overcome biases and accept this Gift, we receive <em>Jeevan Mukti</em> (Eternal Life), securing <em>Moksha</em> (salvation). Lord Shri Jesus is not bound by religion; His Gift is universal.
</p>

<h2 class="subhead">God’s Redemptive Path</h2>

<p>
    God has become both the Way (<em>prayaschit</em>) and the Means (internal Guru) to achieve Mukti. Instead of striving to reach God through human effort, we are invited to yield to God’s effort to reach us.
</p>

<p>
    Is this sufficient <em>Veda</em> (knowledge) for you to take the step of faith? Will you express your willingness to accept God’s way in silent prayer? If you do, you will connect with your Creator.
