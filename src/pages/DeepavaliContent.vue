  <h1>Deepavali and the Light of Lord Shri Jesus</h1>

<p>The festival of Deepavali is a beautiful celebration of light overcoming darkness and good triumphing over what troubles the soul. It is a time of joy, reflection, and hope.</p>

<p>Deepavali reminds me of the words of Lord Shri Jesus:</p>

<blockquote>
    “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life.”
</blockquote>

<p>Just as the Deepavali lamps symbolize the victory of light, they also remind us of how Lord Shri Jesus' perfect life and selfless sacrifice can free us from the inner darkness that weighs on our hearts.</p>

<blockquote>
    “In him was life, and that life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”
</blockquote>

<p>As we look forward to the end of Kalyug, we also await the return of Lord Shri Jesus, who will bring everlasting light to this world.</p>

<p>Today, you too can experience freedom from your burdens through the light of Lord Shri Jesus Christ. He invites us, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
    “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”
</blockquote>

<p>Lord Shri Jesus is coming again to dispel the darkness of Kalyug and bring lasting peace. May Lord Shri Jesus, through His divine light, fill your life with hope, peace, and joy this Deepavali.</p>

<h2>On this occasion of Deepavali, you can pray…</h2>

<blockquote>
    Lord Shri Jesus, I bow my head at your feet. You have said that if I seek you with all my heart, I will surely find you. Lord Shri Jesus, you are the supreme light—let your divine light shine within me, lifting every burden and freeing me from the darkness that troubles my soul. Fill my heart with your presence and guide me in your way of peace. Reveal yourself to me, that I may walk in your light and rest in your love.
