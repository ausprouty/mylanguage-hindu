    <h1>Happy Deepavali</h1>

    <p>
        The festival of Deepavali is a beautiful and dazzling time of fun and religious observance. It reminds us of the victory of light over darkness and good over evil.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Lord Shri Jesus Christ said, "I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall never walk in darkness but will have the light of life."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The Deepavali lamps remind us of Lord Shri Jesus Christ's victory over the darkness of sin that resides in all of us. His sinless life and sacrificial death have the power to blot out the darkness of sin from us.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Regarding His getting up alive again after death, Lord Shri Jesus Christ said, "I am the resurrection and the life, he who believes in me will live, even though he dies."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Devotee John said about Lord Shri Jesus in the Scriptures, "In him was life, and that life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it."
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, you can be freed from your darkness through the light of Lord Shri Jesus Christ. Lord Shri Jesus is coming back again to destroy the darkness of Kalyug. May Almighty God, through His divine light, dispel all your darkness and bring in light.
    </p>

    <h2>A Deepavali Prayer</h2>

    <p>On this occasion of Deepavali, you can pray:</p>

    <blockquote>
        Eternal Father, Son, Holy Spirit, I bow my head at your feet. <br>
        Father, you have said that, if I seek you with all of my heart, I will certainly find you. <br>
        Lord Shri Jesus Christ, you are the supreme light, let your divine light destroy all my darkness and free me from all evil. <br>
        Holy Spirit, transform my heart and take residence in me. <br>
        Triune God, reveal yourself to me. So be it.
