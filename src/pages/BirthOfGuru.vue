    <h2>Birth of the Guru</h2>
    <div><p>Let’s start with a group of astrologers who saw a strange new star about 2,000 years ago.  These astrologers lived someplace east of Israel – maybe Persia or the Arabian Peninsula.The new star led them to believe that a new king had been born in Israel.  So they started on a long trip to visit this king, show their respect and give him gifts.</p>
      <p>When these astrologers arrived in Jerusalem (the capitol city of Israel) their news caused quite a stir.  There was no new king there.  The current king (Herod) was most upset.  He was a cruel man who had executed his wife and three of his sons because he viewed as threats to his reign.</p><p>
King Herod called for the religious leaders and asked them to search the holy writings to see if they could shed any light on where this new king would be born.  They said that 700 years ago the prophet Micah had predicted that a ruler would be born in Bethlehem who would shepherd the people.</p><p>
King Herod met with the astrologers and asked the exact time the start had appeared.  Then he told them to continue their search in the nearby town of Bethlehem and when they had found the boy to bring him a report so that he too could worship him. But he was being devious. He really planned to kill the child.</p><p>
The star guided the astrologers to the place where the child was.  When they saw him, they were overjoyed, bowed down and worshipped him.  Then they gave him their gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</p><p>
These are odd gifts to give a child.  But each of them has a special significance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gold is a precious metal associated with kingship, wealth, and royalty. The gift of gold to Jesus symbolizes his royal standing as the King of Kings. It also signifies his divinity and the reverence and honor due to him as the Son of God.

  </li>
 <li>Frankincense is a fragrant resin used in religious ceremonies and symbolizes worship, prayer, and divinity. The gift of frankincense represents the spiritual aspect of Lord Jesus's identity, acknowledging him as a divine being and signifying the spiritual significance of his life and mission.
</li>
 <li>
Myrrh is an aromatic resin used in embalming and symbolizes suffering, death, and sacrifice. The gift of myrrh is often seen as a foreshadowing of Lord Jesus's sacrificial death on the cross. It represents the suffering and sacrifice that Lord Jesus would endure for the salvation of humanity.

 </li>
</ul>
<p>The astrologers were then warned in a dream not to go back to Jerusalem, so having completed the job which God gave them to do they returned to their country by another route.</p>
<p>What happened next?  I suggest you watch the video of the Life of the Lord Jesus to see what He did to enable people to get to the top of the Mountain of God.  You will discover why many consider him a guru worth following. </p>
